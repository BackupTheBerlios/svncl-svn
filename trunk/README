=====svncl.pl=====

===generate a GNU compilant ChangeLog file from the svn log messages===

Usage: svn log -v --xml | svncl.pl > ChangeLog

There are already some other scripts doing the very same job. So why just
writing another script for this?

Because I like the simple things. And because I wanted the data to be
slightly more preprocessed then the existing tools do to get a more
comprehensive changelog. 

All consecutive log entries from the same author on the same day are unified
to only one ChangeLog entry. The other tools I know of simply produce a
longish sequence of one line entries. That's ok, if you commit only one time
a day, but very talkative if you prefer to do 20 small commits per day.

The other point are the author names. svn only lists the login names of the
committing project members, but a fully-fledged changelog should list the
full names and email adresses. svncl.pl automatically replaces all known
names by using a internal list (simple things, you remember?)



====Installation====

Actually, there is no installation. Just unpack and copy svncl.pl somewhere
in your path. Later you can add a list of known full names to make you
ChangeLogs more complete (see configuation below)

No bulky dependencies, only a working perl enviroment with the LWP and
HTML::Browser packages are needed. They are already present in almost every
perl distribution.


====Usage====

Just give a verbose svn logfile in xml as input on stdin or as a file name
argument and you will get a nicely sorted ChangeLog:

<terminal>
$> svn log -v --xml | svncl.pl > ChangeLog
</terminal>

Or if prefer to separate the two steps:

<terminal>
$> svn log -v --xml > log.xml
$> svncl.pl log.xml > ChangeLog
</terminal>


Due to the log entry unification and the name replacement a version history
like this:

results in a ChangeLog entry like this:

<code>
2010-06-18  Michael Mayer (tenbaht)  <michael-mayer@gmx.de>

    * GCDVDSpot.pm: removed the plugin as dvdspot.com was shut down Okt. 2008

    * GCMediadis.pm: added rating, added director+actor to search window, fixed
      actors name mangling and more minor changes

    * GCFilmAffinityEN.pm, GCFilmAffinityES.pm: add rating, sync both
      GCFilmAffinityE* files

    * GCAnimeNfoA.pm: added rating
</code>



====Configuration====

If you like to use the address translation you have to enter the full names
and email addresses first. Currently this translation table is hardwired in
the sources. Maybe a little bit too simple, I know. But it works. Reliable.

Just edit svncl.pl in function 'start' at line 156 and add all the names you
want to be replaced. Using a config file would be easy as well, but I am
lazy. It is a simple task, so I like to use a simple tool for it.



====other tools that do the same job====

I am sure this list is not complete, but I know at least of these two:

===svn2cl: Subversion ChangeLog generator===
by Arthur De Jong, http://arthurdejong.org/svn2cl/
It a xsl stylesheet with a bash script wrapper. Easy to use but it did't
unify multiple commits on the same day.

===svn2log===
http://freshmeat.net/projects/svn2log/
Written in python. I couldn't get it running even after installing all
python libs.


====Format of the resulting ChangeLog====

In the conversion process text enclosed in '[]' at the beginning of a log
messages is discarded, as this is supposed to be the filename which will be
included anyway. If the contributers full name or email adress is known to
the programm it is included in the log entry as well.

The resulting file is not exactly in GNU format, but very close. The two
differences are:

  - If the full name is known, the login name is added in parenthes, separated
    from the full name by one space.
  - for multi line messages the following lines are indended by 6 spaces, not
    4 like the gnu format.

Both deviations should not break anything if you use other tools or editors
for further log file processing as name and email adress are still seperated
by two spaces, the full name and login by only one.
